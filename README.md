The automatic test rating system utilizes two csv files: one containing student responses and the other containing correct answers. This system streamlines the evaluation process by processing data from the input files. Upon comparing the student's responses with the correct answers, the system assigns corresponding positive or negative points to each student's score. The system's objective is to generate both a csv and pdf file, which include the student index and their percentage of correct answers during a specific examination period within a course. This automatic system has been implemented to simplify the grading process for teachers and to offer students quicker access to their results.
